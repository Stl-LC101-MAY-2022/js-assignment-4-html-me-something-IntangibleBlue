               <p>In the Spring of 2016 I was enrolled in my next to last semester of college coursework for my Bachelor's degree. At the time I was content to be single, as I had notion to move (or maybe even join the Peace Corps), immediatelly following my graduation. In consideration of this, I was not actively looking for a partner, but the Universe had other plans. Before the official start of classes for the Fall semester, I was to meet with a few other students who would be working alongside me in a research lab. During this initial meeting I met a woman who immediately captured my attention, one that I became instantly enamored with. She was wild, eccentric, and refreshingly authentic. Feverishly working to submit and application to graduate school, and largely disinterested in the goings on of that first meeting for our research lab. I would later come to find out that she had participated in research labs for this professor several times before, which explains what appeared to be disinterest at the time. This wasn't her first rodeo. As luck would have it, this wasn't the only academic endeavor that we would be partaking in together this semester. We were also in the same Captsone class, and eventually ended up randomly assigned to the same group. It was this last event that led to what would become our first date.</p>

               <p>The young woman who would someday became my wife, the same one who had somehow ended up working with me in a seemingly unlikely number of places, also turned out to be a very driven individual who knew just what she wanted. It was this drive that led her to ask me to meet with her outside of our usual class time, on what would have been an otherwise pedestrian Saturday morning at her favorite coffee shop. I think we both went in with the intent to work on our Capstone project together. Instead we spent the whole of the morning, and some of the afternoon in deep conversation. The exact amount of time spent at the coffee shop that day is up for debate, I contest that it was a little over 4 hours that day, she maintains that it was nearer to 6. Either way we both walked away from the coffee shop that day with a strong apprecation for each other, and a deep desire to meet again. Years later, I would come to find out that she called her mom on the way back to her car to tell her that she had met her future husband. </p>

               <p>Fast forward approximately 11 months, to December of 2016. Future wife had since moved to New York to pursue her Master's Degree in Art Therapy, and I had made several romantic trips via train to visit her </p>
